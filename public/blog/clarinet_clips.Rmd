Here are some of my favorite clarinet clips. I have watched them countless times.

### Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker for the clarinet and orchestra

Sergey's playing is so lyrical. He sings with the clarinet. I can listen to his playing all day. 

### Rossini's Introduction, Theme and Variations

Valentin's articulation is god-level. His conducting is also god-level. Everything about this so god. His cadenza in the end is legendary! 


### Spohr #2 concerto

The soloist effortlessly plays this notoriously difficult piece. His clarinet produces a thin, light sound that is characteristic of the German clarinet.

### Bach's cello suite #1 with the Bass Clarinet

Baldeyrou's arrangement of Bach's cello suite #1's first movement. His tone resembles the sound of cello.
